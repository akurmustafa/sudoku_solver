# Sudoku Solver in C++

A project for automatic sudoku solving in c++. 

## Getting Started

This Project is written in Visual Studio 19, with C++17 compiler. However code should be portable just download the src folder and compile and link files under it. 

### Prerequisites

You need a cpp compiler later than C++11 to be able to recompile source files, in my machine I have used MSVC C++ 17


## Deployment

It would be nice to have web interface where user can enter sudoku table and get the result back, maybe I can add it in the future.


## Contributing

I didn't do extensive unit tests, if you can spot error, or have suggestions for improvement feel free to implement them and pull request
